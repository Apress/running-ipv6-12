This archive contains all the listings from the book. This includes the
ones that are example output etc. There are no listings in Chapter 1 and
Appendix A.

The first line is always a description of the listing. On systems that
have the "tail" command (such as Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS) you can strip
off this first line with:

tail +2 <file>

The files are in UNIX-style text format. That means that some
applications under Windows (such as Notepad) will not display them
correctly. Wordpad or a browser such as Internet Explorer will open the
files without trouble.
